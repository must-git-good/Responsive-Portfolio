                        <p>I'm currently a student at UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp. This portfolio is an example of some of the (very beginning) work we did in that program. If you're viewing this, you're presumably either stalking my github (feel free), or a bootcamp instructor or TA. Either way, you're welcome, but please know that a "real" portfolio is being developed which will give you a bit more in-depth information about myself and my unique strengths as a developing web developer!
